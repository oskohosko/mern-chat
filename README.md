MERN Full-Stack Chat Application using web sockets, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js and React.
Purpose of this application for me is to learn :).

## Main Features

### Authentication
Full authentication system with a REST API. 
Users are saved in MongoDB and passwords are encrpyted using bcrypt.
JWT saved in cookies.
Middleware to protect routes.

### React Front End
Interactive front end using React, Daisy UI and Tailwind CSS for visuals.

### Web Sockets using Socket.io
Socket.io allows us to have realtime updates with messages between two people.

### MongoDB Database
Users and Messages are saved in my MongoDB database.

## Testing
Continuous testing done using Postman for the APIs and I've got friends testing it after it was deployed.

## Deployment
App has been deployed using Render.

## Overview
Fun app to help me develop my Full Stack skills and learn more about React and deploying an application.
Aim is to help give me a foundation to build off for more projects and bigger applications.
Bonus is that I'm able to use it with my friends.
